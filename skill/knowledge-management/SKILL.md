# Knowledge Management

Note capture and knowledge organization using Anytype as the backend.

## Status: Stub

This skill is a placeholder for future development. Core functionality to be added:

## Planned Features

### Quick Note Capture
- Minimal friction capture to Anytype
- Auto-tagging based on content
- Link to related notes

### Knowledge Retrieval
- Semantic search across notes
- Tag-based filtering
- Connection discovery

### Resource Organization
- PARA Resources category management
- Topic clustering
- Archive maintenance

### Documentation Management
- Technical docs organization
- Version tracking
- Cross-reference linking

## Integration Points

- **Anytype**: Primary storage (Resources type)
- **task-management**: Link notes to projects/areas
- **research**: Save research findings

## Quick Commands (Future)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `note: [content]` | Quick capture |
| `find notes on [topic]` | Search knowledge base |
| `link [note] to [note]` | Create connection |
| `organize [tag/topic]` | Cluster related notes |

## Anytype Types

- `note` - Quick captures
- `resource` - Organized reference material
- `document` - Formal documentation

## Notes

Expand based on actual note-taking patterns. Consider integration with mem0-memory skill for AI-assisted recall.
