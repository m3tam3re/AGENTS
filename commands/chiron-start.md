# Morning Planning

Start the day with clarity and intention.

## Steps

1. **Read yesterday's daily note** from `~/CODEX/daily/YYYY/MM/DD/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Check today's tasks** in `~/CODEX/tasks/inbox.md` and project files
3. **Prioritize using energy levels and deadlines** (consult `chiron-core` for PARA guidance)
4. **Generate today's focus** (3-5 top priorities, deep work blocks, quick wins)
5. **Ask**: "Ready to start, or need to adjust?"

## Expected Output

Daily note with:
- Focus areas (top 3 priorities)
- Deep work blocks (scheduled)
- Quick wins (<15min)
- Meetings
- Carried over tasks
- Inbox status
