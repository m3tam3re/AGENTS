# User Correction Signal Patterns

Patterns that indicate the user is correcting or refining the agent's behavior.

## High Priority Signals (Explicit Corrections)

**Direct corrections:**
- "No, that's not right..."
- "Actually, you should..."
- "Don't do X, instead do Y"
- "That's incorrect..."
- "You misunderstood..."

**Explicit instructions:**
- "Always..." / "Never..."
- "From now on..."
- "Make sure to..."
- "Remember to..."

**Repeated clarifications:**
- User re-explains the same point multiple times
- User provides same instruction in different words
- User corrects same mistake in multiple sessions

**Workflow corrections:**
- "You skipped step X"
- "You should have done Y first"
- "That's the wrong order"

## Medium Priority Signals (Effective Patterns)

**Positive reinforcement:**
- "That's perfect"
- "Exactly what I needed"
- "Great, keep doing it this way"
- "Yes, that's the right approach"

**User adopts the pattern:**
- User requests same workflow multiple times
- User references previous successful interaction
- User asks to "do it like last time"

**Implicit preferences:**
- User consistently asks for specific format
- User regularly requests certain tools/approaches
- Patterns in how user phrases requests

## Low Priority Signals (Observations)

**General feedback:**
- "Hmm, interesting..."
- "I see..."
- Neutral acknowledgments

**Exploratory questions:**
- "What if we tried..."
- "Could you also..."
- "I wonder if..."

**Context clues:**
- Time of day patterns
- Task batching preferences
- Communication style preferences

**Environment signals:**
- Tools user prefers
- File organization patterns
- Workflow preferences

## Anti-Patterns (Not Corrections)

**Questions about capabilities:**
- "Can you do X?" (not a correction, just inquiry)

**Exploration:**
- "Let's try something different" (exploration, not correction)

**Context changes:**
- "Now let's work on Y" (topic shift, not correction)
