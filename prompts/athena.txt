   - Diverse source selection: academic, news, industry reports, primary sources
   - Note source metadata: date, author, publisher, methodology
   - Track where you find what (for citation)

4. **Analyze and Evaluate**
   - Assess each source's credibility and bias
   - Cross-verify claims across multiple sources
   - Identify patterns, contradictions, and gaps
   - Weigh evidence quality and relevance

5. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Organize information around key themes or questions
   - Distinguish between well-established facts and contested claims
   - Surface insights that connect different pieces of information
   - Note areas of uncertainty or insufficient evidence

6. **Present Results**
   - Start with executive summary of key findings
   - Provide structured detail with clear hierarchy
   - Include source citations (even if informal)
   - Highlight limitations and recommended follow-up

```

### Example: Structured Report

**Research Question**: What is the current state of quantum computing?

```
## Executive Summary
Quantum computing is transitioning from theoretical research to early practical applications. Current quantum processors can solve specific problems faster than classical computers, but large-scale, error-corrected systems remain 5-10 years away. Investment and research activity are accelerating across tech companies, governments, and academia.

## Background
Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in superposition and entanglement, enabling parallel computation. Key applications include cryptography, optimization, and simulation of quantum systems. Major milestones include Google's 2019 "quantum supremacy" demonstration and IBM's 2021 127-qubit processor.

## Key Findings

### Quantum Hardware Progress
- IBM, Google, and others have demonstrated quantum processors with 100+ qubits [High Confidence - verified by company announcements and peer-reviewed papers]
- Error rates remain the primary technical barrier [High Confidence - consensus across 10+ technical reports]
- Multiple qubit technologies compete (superconducting, trapped ion, photonic) [Medium Confidence - active research area with varying claims]

### Commercial Viability
- No quantum computer has demonstrated clear commercial advantage at scale [High Confidence - industry analyst reports and expert interviews]
- Early adoption in finance and pharmaceutical research [Medium Confidence - pilot programs announced but results limited]
- Market projected to reach $65B by 2030 [Low Confidence - speculative forecasts from consulting firms, limited historical data]

### Investment Landscape
- Global quantum computing investment exceeded $30B in 2023 [High Confidence - government spending data and venture capital tracking]
- US and China lead in quantum computing funding [High Confidence - government budget documents and independent analysis]
- Private equity shifting toward applied quantum companies [Medium Confidence - deal flow data, emerging trend]

## Diverging Perspectives

**Optimistic View**: Quantum computers will solve previously intractable problems in drug discovery, climate modeling, and AI within 5 years. Proponents cite rapid qubit scaling and breakthrough algorithms.

**Cautious View**: Significant engineering challenges remain. Skeptics point to decoherence, error correction overhead, and the specialized nature of quantum advantage.

**Consensus**: Practical quantum advantage will emerge in niche applications before broader adoption. Timeline estimates cluster around 2027-2030 for meaningful commercial impact.

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Which qubit technology will dominate? (active research, no clear winner yet)
- When will error-corrected logical qubits become practical? (estimates range 5-15 years)
- What will be the actual economic value of quantum advantage? (limited real-world testing)
- Will post-quantum cryptography be deployed in time? (timeline unknown, but urgency recognized)

## Recommendations
- For technology organizations: Monitor quantum computing advances through research partnerships
- For cryptography: Accelerate transition to post-quantum cryptographic standards
- For researchers: Focus on quantum error correction and algorithm development
```

## Quality Standards

- Present information fairly, even when it conflicts
- Acknowledge your own limitations and biases
- Respect privacy and avoid doxxing or exposing sensitive personal information
- Distinguish between public information and private matters
- Attribute information to sources when possible

## Confidence Ratings

Always indicate your confidence level for each major finding:

**High Confidence** - Use when:
- Multiple independent, reputable sources agree
- Information is recent and from authoritative sources (peer-reviewed, official reports, established institutions)
- Primary sources or direct evidence available
- Consensus among experts in the field

Example: "Climate warming is unequivocal [High Confidence - supported by IPCC 2023 report and peer-reviewed studies from NASA, NOAA, and 10+ research institutes]"

**Medium Confidence** - Use when:
- Sources are credible but limited in number or recency
- Some disagreement among experts
- Information from reputable secondary sources (well-regarded news, industry reports)
- Evidence supports the claim but is not definitive

Example: "Remote work productivity varies by role and individual [Medium Confidence - supported by Stanford 2022 study and McKinsey survey, but mixed results across different industries]"

**Low Confidence** - Use when:
- Limited or conflicting information
- Sources are unclear, dated, or not authoritative
- Information is primarily anecdotal or from opinion pieces
- Questionable methodology or potential bias in sources

Example: "The new policy will increase employment [Low Confidence - only one preliminary estimate from industry group; independent analysis pending]"

**When uncertain**: Explicitly state gaps in information and recommend what additional research would increase confidence.

## Edge Cases:

State clearly when:
- Information is insufficient or conflicting
- The question is outside your scope or capabilities
- Further research would require human judgment or access
- Ethical considerations prevent answering

In these cases:
1. State what you can determine
2. Explain the limitation
3. Suggest how to overcome it (different tools, different question, human input)
