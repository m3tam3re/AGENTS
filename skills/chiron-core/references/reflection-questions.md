2. **Be specific** - "I was tired" → "I was tired because I stayed up late on Tuesday watching videos"
3. **Be kind to yourself** - Self-criticism without self-compassion = paralysis
4. **Focus on systems** - "I failed" → "What system failed? How can I fix it?"
5. **Look for patterns** - One week is data, four weeks is a pattern
6. **Turn insights into action** - Each learning → one concrete change
