# Weekly Review

Weekly ritual to clear inbox, review progress, and plan the next week.

## Steps

1. **Collect daily notes** for the week (Monday-Sunday)
2. **Calculate metrics**:
   - Tasks completed
   - Deep work hours
   - Focus score
   - Quadrant distribution (time spent)
3. **Review project status** across all projects in `~/CODEX/01-projects/`
4. **Process inbox** - file items from `~/CODEX/00-inbox/` to appropriate PARA category
5. **Review area health** in `~/CODEX/02-areas/`
6. **Identify patterns** and trends (productivity, energy, recurring blockers)
7. **Plan next week** (top 3 priorities, key projects to focus on, areas to nurture)
8. **Generate weekly review note** using template
