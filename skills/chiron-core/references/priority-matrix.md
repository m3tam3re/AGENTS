# Priority Matrix (Eisenhower)

## The Matrix

Prioritize tasks based on two dimensions:

1. **Urgency** - Time-sensitive
2. **Importance** - Impact on goals

| | **Important** | **Not Important** |
|---|---------------|------------------|
| **Urgent** | ⏫ Critical 🔥 | 🔼 High (Do or Delegate) |
| **Not Urgent** | 🔼 High (Schedule) | 🔽 Low (Eliminate) |

## Quadrant Breakdown

### Quadrant 1: Urgent & Important (⏫ Critical)

**Do immediately. These are crises or deadlines.**

**Characteristics:**
- Time-sensitive
- Has direct impact
- Must be done now
- Often stressful

**Examples:**
- Project due today
- Client emergency
- Health issue
- Financial deadline

**Strategy:**
- Handle now
- Identify root causes (why was it urgent?)
- Prevent recurrence through planning

### Quadrant 2: Not Urgent & Important (🔼 High - Schedule)

**This is where quality happens. These are your priorities.**

**Characteristics:**
- Strategic work
- Long-term goals
- Personal growth
- Relationship building

**Examples:**
- Strategic planning
- Skill development
- Exercise
- Deep work projects
- Relationship time

**Strategy:**
- **Block time** on calendar
- Protect from interruptions
- Schedule first (before urgent items)
- This should be 60-80% of your time

### Quadrant 3: Urgent & Not Important (🔼 High - Do or Delegate)

**These are distractions. Minimize or delegate.**

**Characteristics:**
- Time-sensitive but low impact
- Other people's priorities
- Interruptions
- Some meetings

**Examples:**
- Most email
- Some meetings
- Coworker requests
- Unscheduled calls
- Many notifications

**Strategy:**
- **Delegate** if possible
- Say no more often
- Batch process (check email 2x/day)
- Set expectations about response time
- Aim to minimize this to <20%

### Quadrant 4: Not Urgent & Not Important (🔽 Low - Eliminate)

**These are time-wasters. Remove them.**

**Characteristics:**
- No urgency
- No importance
- Entertainment masquerading as work
- Habits that don't serve you

**Examples:**
- Doom scrolling
- Excessive social media
- Mindless TV
- Busy work that has no impact
- Low-priority tasks you procrastinate on

**Strategy:**
- **Eliminate** ruthlessly
- Set time limits
- Use app blockers if needed
- Replace with value activities

## Task Priority Symbols

Use these symbols in your task format:

```markdown
- [ ] Task description #tag ⏫ 📅 YYYY-MM-DD
```

| Symbol | Meaning | When to use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ⏫ | Critical (Q1) | Urgent AND important |
| 🔼 | High (Q2/Q3) | Important but not urgent OR urgent but delegate-able |
| 🔽 | Low (Q4) | Neither urgent nor important |

## Daily Prioritization Workflow

### Morning Plan

1. **List all tasks for today**
2. **Categorize by quadrant**:
   ```
   ⏫ Critical (Do Now):
   - [Task 1]
   - [Task 2]

   🔼 High (Schedule):
   - [Task 3]
   - [Task 4]

   🔽 Low (Maybe):
   - [Task 5]
   ```

3. **Limit Critical tasks**: Max 3-4 per day
4. **Schedule High tasks**: Block time on calendar
5. **Eliminate Low tasks**: Remove or move to someday/maybe

### Time Blocking

**Rule of thumb:**
- 60-80% in Quadrant 2 (strategic work)
- 20% in Quadrant 1 (crises)
- <20% in Quadrant 3 (distractions)
- 0% in Quadrant 4 (eliminate)

**Example schedule:**
```
9:00-11:00  Deep work (Q2) - Project X
11:00-11:30 Handle crises (Q1) - Urgent email
11:30-12:30 Deep work (Q2) - Project X
12:30-13:30 Lunch & break
13:30-14:30 Distractions (Q3) - Batch email
14:30-16:30 Deep work (Q2) - Project Y
16:30-17:00 Wrap up (Q1)
```

## Energy-Based Prioritization

Not all critical tasks should be done at the same time. Consider:

| Energy Level | Best Tasks |
|--------------|------------|
| High (morning) | Complex, creative work (Q2) |
| Medium (midday) | Communication, meetings (Q3) |
| Low (evening) | Admin, simple tasks (Q1 easy wins) |

**Morning energy:**
- Complex problem-solving
- Writing
- Creative work
- Strategic thinking

**Midday energy:**
- Meetings
- Email
- Calls
- Collaboration

**Low energy:**
- Admin tasks
- Filing
- Planning
- Review

## Context-Specific Prioritization

Different contexts require different approaches:

**Work context:**
- Prioritize team deadlines
- Consider stakeholder expectations
- Balance strategic vs tactical

**Personal context:**
- Prioritize health and well-being
- Consider relationships
- Balance work-life boundaries

**Emergency context:**
- Quadrant 1 dominates
- Defer Q2 tasks
- Accept disruption to normal flow

## Common Pitfalls

### **Mistreating Urgency for Importance**

**Problem**: Responding to urgent but unimportant items (Q3) first.

**Solution**: Start with Q2 (schedule important work) before checking email/notifications.

### **Overcommitting to Critical (Q1)**

**Problem**: Having 10+ critical tasks creates paralysis and stress.

**Solution**: Limit to 3-4 critical tasks per day. Move rest to Q2 with realistic deadlines.

### **Neglecting Q2**

**Problem**: Always in reactive mode, never proactive.

**Solution**: Schedule 60-80% of time for Q2. Protect these blocks fiercely.

### **Faking Urgency**

**Problem**: Making tasks urgent to avoid doing them (procrastination disguised as crisis).

**Solution**: Question urgency. "Is this truly time-sensitive, or just uncomfortable?"

### **Perfectionism in Q2**

**Problem**: Spending too long on strategic planning, never executing.

**Solution**: Set time limits for planning. Action produces learning.

## Integration with Chiron Workflows

**Morning Plan**: Use matrix to identify 3-5 ⏫ critical tasks and schedule Q2 blocks

**Weekly Review**: Evaluate how much time was spent in each quadrant, adjust for next week

**Daily Review**: Review urgency/importance of remaining tasks

**Project Planning**: Break projects into Q2 tasks, identify potential Q1 crises

## Quick Reference

```
⏫ = Do now (Urgent + Important)
🔼 = Schedule (Important) OR Delegate (Urgent but not important)
🔽 = Eliminate (Neither urgent nor important)

Goal: 60-80% time on 🔼 (Quadrant 2)
Limit ⏫ to 3-4 per day
Minimize 🔼 (Quadrant 3) to <20%
Eliminate 🔽
```
