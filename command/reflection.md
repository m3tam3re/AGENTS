description: Toggle reflection mode on/off for automatic skill improvement detection
---

Reflection mode is now set to: $1

When reflection mode is **ON**, I will:
- Actively monitor for user correction signals during conversation
- Detect patterns where you correct my behavior  
- Automatically suggest skill improvements when clear signals detected
- Proactively ask "Should I reflect on this?" when corrections occur

When reflection mode is **OFF** (default), I will:
- Only perform reflection when explicitly requested
- Respond to explicit commands like "reflect on [skill]"
- No automatic signal detection or suggestions

Current mode: **$1**

Note: This setting is session-scoped and will reset to OFF in new sessions.
