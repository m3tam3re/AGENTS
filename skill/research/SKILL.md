# Research

Research and investigation workflows for informed decision-making.

## Status: Stub

This skill is a placeholder for future development. Core functionality to be added:

## Planned Features

### Investigation Workflow
- Multi-source research (web, docs, code)
- Source credibility assessment
- Summary with drill-down capability

### Technology Evaluation
- Feature comparison matrices
- Pros/cons analysis
- Fit-for-purpose assessment

### Best Practices Discovery
- Industry standards lookup
- Implementation patterns
- Common pitfalls

### Learning Path Generation
- Topic breakdown
- Resource recommendations
- Progress tracking

## Integration Points

- **Anytype**: Save research findings to Resources
- **Web Search**: Primary research source
- **librarian agent**: External documentation lookup

## Quick Commands (Future)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `research [topic]` | Start research session |
| `compare [A] vs [B]` | Feature comparison |
| `best practices [topic]` | Lookup standards |
| `learn [topic]` | Generate learning path |

## Notes

Expand this skill based on actual research patterns that emerge from usage.
