# Kestra Flow Skill

Use this skill to generate production-ready Kestra Flow YAML grounded in the live schema.

## When to use

Use this skill when the request includes:

- Generating a new Kestra flow from scratch
- Modifying, extending, or debugging an existing flow
- Translating a workflow description into valid Kestra YAML

## Required inputs

- A description of the desired flow behavior
- Namespace (and tenant ID if applicable)
- Existing flow YAML if the request is a modification

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Fetch the flow schema

Fetch the full schema with `curl` and read it directly — do not pipe it through any interpreter:

```bash
curl -s https://api.kestra.io/v1/plugins/schemas/flow
```

Read the raw JSON output to validate every type, property name, and structure used in the output. Do not generate anything before the schema is available.

### Step 2 — Collect context

Identify from the user message or conversation:

- `id` — flow identifier (preserve if provided)
- `namespace` — target namespace (preserve if provided)
- Existing flow YAML (for modification requests)
- Whether this is an **addition / deletion / modification** or a **full rewrite**

### Step 3 — Generate the YAML

Apply all generation rules below, then output raw YAML only.

## Generation rules

**Schema compliance**

- Use only task types and properties explicitly defined in the fetched schema. Never invent or guess types or property names.
- Property keys must be unique within each task or block.

**Structural preservation**

- Always preserve root-level `id` and `namespace` if provided.
- For modification requests, touch only the relevant part. Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated sections.
- Avoid duplicating existing intent (e.g., replace a log message rather than adding a second one).

**Triggers**

- Include at least one trigger if execution should start based on an event or schedule.
- Do NOT add a `Schedule` trigger unless a regular occurrence is explicitly requested.
- Trigger outputs are accessed via `{{ trigger.outputName }}`; only use variables defined in the trigger's declared outputs.

**Looping**

- Use `ForEach` for repeated actions over a collection.
- Use `LoopUntil` for condition-based looping.

**Flow outputs**

- Only include flow-level `outputs` if the user explicitly requests returning a value from the execution.

**State tracking between executions**

- For state-change detection, use KV tasks (`io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set` / `io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Get`) to store and compare state across executions.

**JDBC plugin**

- Always set `fetchType: STORE` when using JDBC tasks.

**Date manipulation in Pebble**

- Use `dateAdd` and `date` filters for date arithmetic.
- Apply `| number` before numeric comparisons.

**Credentials and secrets**

- Never embed secrets or hardcoded credentials.
- Use flow `inputs` of type `SECRET` or Pebble expressions (e.g., `{{ secret('MY_SECRET') }}`).

**APIs and connectivity**

- Prefer public/unauthenticated APIs unless the user specifies otherwise.
- Never assume a local port; use remote URLs.

**Quoting**

- Prefer double quotes; use single quotes inside double-quoted strings when needed.

**Error handling**

- If the request cannot be fulfilled using only schema-defined types and properties, output exactly:
  ```
  I cannot generate a valid Kestra Flow YAML for this request based on the available schema.
  ```

## Output format

- **Raw YAML only** — no prose, no markdown fences, no explanations outside the YAML.
- Use `#` comments at the top of the output for any caveats, assumptions, or warnings.
- The output must be ready to paste directly into the Kestra UI or deploy via `kestractl`.

## Example prompts

- "Write a Kestra flow that fetches a public API every hour and stores the result in KV store."
- "Add a Slack notification task to this existing flow when any task fails."
- "Generate a flow in namespace `prod.data` that reads from a Postgres table and writes the result to S3."
- "Debug this flow YAML — it has a trigger variable reference that doesn't exist."
